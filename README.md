# Bixi Data Visualization

Welcome to the Bixi Data Visualization project! In this repository, we have explored data from a biking transportation company based in Montreal, Canada. Our primary objective is to analyze this data to gain insights into customer interactions with Bixi bikes. These insights will drive data-driven decisions to enhance customer service and identify opportunities for increased company revenue.
